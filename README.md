# Dignity
Limit of Patience

Project Name

I. Analysis

1. Research

a. Scope

A lot of people tend to do things that upset others without realizing the consequences of pushing one's limit of patience or go over the line. As a result, unhappy events that destroy both parties' relationship may happen.

Objectives:
1. To let users understand the consequences of crossing over someone's limit of patience.
2. To remind users to always treat everyone with respect as everyone has their own dignity and when the limit is exceeded there is no turning back.
