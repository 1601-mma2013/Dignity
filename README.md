# Don't
"Dignity"-Limit of Patience

## I. Analysis

### 1. Research

### a. Scope

A lot of young adults nowadays tend to do things that upset others without realizing the consequences of pushing one's limit of patience or go over the line. As a result, unhappy events that destroy both parties' relationship may happen. "Don't" is a project 

: To let users understand the consequences of crossing over someone's limit of patience.

: To let users acknowledge human's secondary emotion, which is dignity.

: To educate and remind young adults to always treat everyone with respect as everyone has their own dignity and when the limit is   exceeded there is no turning back. 

Don't: 

An interactive installation which engages users in a human computer interaction to create awareness among users to be mindful of their behaviour towards others and to never be respectful. This installation allows users to experience the process of pushing one's limit of patience through touch sensing technology. *Don't* relies on the user’s interactions with the projected visuals on a piece of cloth. When the user presses onto the cloth, the action is detected which in turn changes the reaction of the projected visuals on the cloth.

Product vision:
To remind staffs in a company that everyone should be treated with respect, especially the relationship between superiors and subordinates.
